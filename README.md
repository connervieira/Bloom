## Binaries
There are currently no builds available. When finished, binaries will be available at https://v0lttech.com/bloom.php

## Features
### Lovable Character
The protagonist of the game is a robot named Oliver. A lot of attention was put into developing the story, levels, and mechanics around Oliver to make him a lovable character!

### Creative Game Mechanics
In most platformers, the goal is to avoid dying as much as possible. Bloom, on the other hand, uses respawns as a mechanic to complete levels! When you respawn, Oliver's old robot body stays in place, allowing you to use it to complete the level.

### Easy To Learn
The game mechanics of Bloom are quick and easy to learn. Everything you need to know is introduced by a tutorial level in under 60 seconds!

### Completely Original
All the assets used by Bloom are completely original, and made specifically for the project.

### Cross Platform
Bloom runs on both Mac and Linux, allowing for more players to give it a try!

### Open And DRM Free
Bloom is completely open source, and has absolutely no DRM. You can freely share it with anyone you want, as long as you follow the extremely non-restrictive license!

### Unique Story
The storyline of Bloom is simple enough to not overwhelm the game itself, while still being creative enough to be intriguing.

### Lightweight
Bloom doesn't require high end hardware to run well. Even inexpensive computers should be able to run the game at a full 60 frames per second without issue.
